## Lessons Learned

While building this project I learned more about ES6 topics and ReactJS. I learned multiple different ReactJS hooks and there uses like useEffect, useState, and useCallback. I learned how to work with cookies and about CORS. This project taught me a LOT about react and typescript and I hope my project will be able to provide project ideas to people for many years to come!
